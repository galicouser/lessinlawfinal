              accident, you cannot seek to recover damages. If you are found to
              share liability for the crash, your damages will be reduced by
              your percentage of fault.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              There are sometimes caps on the amount of compensation you can
              obtain. Our Pennsylvania car accident lawyers will review your
              case and help you determine how much you could receive if you file
              a Pennsylvania car accident lawsuit.

            Who Is to Blame For My Philadelphia Car Accident?

          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              As lawyers who represent victims of Philadelphia car accidents, we
              spend a lot of time and energy thinking about fault, and for good
              reason. Under Pennsylvania law, who was at fault in a motor
              vehicle accident determines who owes damages to the victim and how
              much the victim should recover. As such, we focus on identifying
              who was at fault in a car accident as soon as possible.

          <h1 className="MainHeading">
            It All Usually Comes Down to Negligence
          </h1>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              In the most basic sense, the person at fault for an accident is
              the one whose actions caused it to happen.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Under Pennsylvania law, the person or entity at fault for an
              accident will be on the hook for paying damages to those injured
              only if that person or entity’s actions were wrongful. Now, most
              of the time, people don’t try to cause a car accident. (Obviously,
              if they do, they’ll be held liable.) Instead, legal liability for
              a car accident usually boils down to whether the person or entity
              at fault acted negligently in causing a motor vehicle accident.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Though most people have heard lawyers use the word negligent, many
              may not fully understand what the term means.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              To prove someone was negligent in their actions, under
              Pennsylvania law, you must prove 4 key elements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Had a duty of care to behave or act responsibly
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                Breached that duty of care by acting in a way that a reasonable
                person would expect to cause the victim harm
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Harmed the victim through those actions
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                Caused the victim to suffer damages as a result of that harm
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              All drivers on Pennsylvania roads owe a duty of care to everyone
              else on the road, including other drivers, bicyclists, and
              pedestrians. That duty requires drivers to operate their vehicles
              in a reasonably safe manner that will avoid accidents and injuries
              to others.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              In Philadelphia and across the state, every driver must follow
              specific laws and regulations. These laws provide guidelines for
              what constitutes that duty of care. When a driver breaks those
              rules and gets into an accident, that violation is evidence that
              he or she was “negligent” behind the wheel.

              Pennsylvania law, who was at fault in a motor vehicle accident
              determines who owes damages to the victim and how much the victim
              should recover. An experienced car accident attorney will usually
              focus on identifying who was at fault in a car accident as soon as
              possible.

              percent of those accidents, aggressive driving was a factor.
              Distracted driving, speeding, and drunk driving all play a role in

          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              In Philadelphia, there are many causes of car accidents. One of
              the most common reasons car accidents occur is because of driver
              negligence. Drivers who are irresponsible behind the wheel may
              engage in a variety of risky driving behaviors, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Driving while intoxicated by drugs or alcohol (DUI)
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">Driving distracted</li>

              <li className="TextPassage">Speeding</li>
              <li className="TextPassage">Tailgating</li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Driving aggressively or unpredictably
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">Failing to obey traffic signals</li>
              <li className="TextPassage">Drowsy driving</li>
              <li className="TextPassage">Driving without a license</li>
              <li className="TextPassage">Road Rage</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              In some cases, defective auto parts can cause serious accidents.
              Defective tires, steering components, and transmissions can cause
              devastating accidents with little warning. These cases are
              different from typical car accident cases because they involve
              product liability laws.

            How Do You Prove Fault After a Philadelphia Car Accident?
          </h1>
          <h2 className="MainHeading">Gathering Evidence After a Car Crash</h2>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              To prove negligence, our lawyers often need to gather independent
              evidence or show the other driver was at fault.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              For example, it may not be enough for you to testify that you saw
              the other driver texting just before the accident happened.
              Instead, our Philadelphia car accident lawyers will need to gather
              real, tangible evidence. This may include the other driver’s
              cellphone records to show the exact moment the driver sent or
              received a text. We may also need to track down other witnesses
              who saw the driver texting.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Our experienced auto accident lawyer understands the kind of
              evidence necessary in Philadelphia courts to demonstrate that the
              other driver’s negligent actions caused an accident.
            </p>

            <ul>

                Photos from the crash scene showing the positioning of the

              <li className="TextPassage">Statements from witnesses</li>

            What If I Am Partly to Blame For the Philadelphia Car Accident?
          </h1>

          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              If you believe that you might be partly to blame for the car
              accident, do not worry. Unless you are more than 50 percent liable
              for the accident, you can still collect compensation. This is due
              to Philadelphia’s modified contributory negligence doctrine.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">Here’s how it works:</p>

            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Under Pennsylvania law, a court will attribute a percentage of
                fault to each party in a car accident lawsuit.
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                So long as your share of fault is less than the total share of
                the fault borne by all defendants combined, the plaintiff can
                recover damages.
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Your recovery from the defendant(s) will be reduced by the
                proportion you are found at fault.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              The rules of modified comparative negligence can make calculating
              fault and damages even more complicated. Sometimes, for example,
              one of the defendants may be on the hook for 100 percent of the
              damages, even if more than one defendant was at fault.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Always consult an experienced Philadelphia car accident attorney
              before taking action to seek damages from someone who caused a
              wreck—especially if someone tries to shift some of the blame to
              you. An attorney at The Lawyer Connection can help sort through
              the parties at fault to identify those who may be both most at
              fault and most capable of paying damages.
