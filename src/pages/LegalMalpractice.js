              Riding a bike can be a great form of exercise, a way to enjoy a
              beautiful day, and an inexpensive and environmentally friendly
              mode of transportation. Unfortunately, it can also become deadly
              when drivers of motor vehicles do not pay attention to the
              bicyclists with whom they are supposed to share the road.
              According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
              52,000 bicyclists were injured and 716 killed in 2008 as a result
              of collisions with motor vehicles. Most of those accidents (69
              percent) occurred in busy urban areas. Twenty-eight bicyclist
              deaths occurred in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 2008.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Unlike people riding in cars or trucks, bicyclists are completely
              exposed to the world around them. Consequently, they are extremely
              vulnerable to serious injuries when they are involved in accidents
              with motor vehicles. These injuries can come from the impact of
              the motor vehicle itself or when an accident throws a bicyclist
              onto to the ground, into traffic, or against another object.
              Cyclists can sustain the following serious injuries in accidents:

                  Traumatic brain injuries–
                </span>
                TBIs can occur anytime a cyclist’s head hits something during
                the course of an accident—including when the cyclist is wearing
                a helmet. Even mild TBIs, like concussions, can result in
                serious symptoms that damage victims’ lives in profound ways for
                days, weeks, or even months. When bicyclists sustain severe TBIs
                that involve skull fractures or objects penetrating into their
                brains, they often develop cognitive or physical disabilities
                that can hurt them for the rest of their lives.{" "}

                spinal column, including ligaments, discs, nerves, or vertebrae,
                can result in spinal cord injuries. Spinal cord injuries can
                result in significant complications, including chronic pain,
                muscle weakness, numbness, and even paralysis below the site of
                the injuries.{" "}

                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Fractures –</span>
                The forces involved in bicycle accidents can easily break a
                person’s bones. Cyclists who are involved in accidents often
                break arms, legs, hips, hands, fingers, and bones in the face.
                In many cases, these injuries require emergency medical
                treatments, from immobilization and traction to emergency and
                reconstructive surgeries.People can sustain these and other
                injuries in bicycle accidents, not only resulting in enormous
                pain and suffering, but also secondary issues such as
                substantial and unexpected medical expenses, lost income from
                the inability to work, and a significant and ongoing loss of
                qualify of life. Fortunately, victims can seek compensation for
                these and other accident-related losses under both Pennsylvania
                and New Jersey law. For this reason, those injured in bicycle
                accidents should retain legal counsel as soon as possible to
                fully protect their legal rights.

          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Though motorists are expected to “share the road” with bicyclists,
              many drivers do not pay proper attention or use enough caution.
              Other reasons may also contribute to serious accidents for bicycle
              riders. Some common reasons for bicycle accidents include the
              following:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">Distracted drivers</li>

              <li className="TextPassage">Aggressive drivers</li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                Intoxicated or otherwise impaired drivers
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">Failure to yield</li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                Failure to check mirrors or blind spots before turning
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Speeding, running red lights, or violating other traffic laws
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                Not checking mirrors before opening a car door

                Potholes, uneven pavement, or other road defects
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              These are only a few examples of how other parties may act in a
              negligent fashion to cause a bicycle accident. If a driver or
              other party’s negligence caused you injury, that party should be
              held responsible for their actions and you deserve to receive a
              fair settlement.

            Driver Negligence Often Causes Serious Bicycle Accidents
          </h1>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Bicyclists must comply with all traffic laws when riding on public
              roadways, just as if they were operating motor vehicles.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Neither motor vehicles nor bicycles have the right of way over the
              other—drivers of both must be aware of all other vehicles and
              follow the rules of the road. Unfortunately, bicyclists, despite
              their best efforts to comply with all appropriate laws, get struck
              by motorists who do not pay attention to their surroundings.
              Sadly, bicyclists suffer the most serious injuries in these
              situations.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              As in other types of accidents, to recover compensation,
              bicyclists must show that someone else’s negligence caused their
              accidents. Negligence occurs when a person fails to use the degree
              of care that a reasonable person in the same or similar
              circumstances would ordinarily use.

              cars and trucks. Nevertheless, in some cases, a driver’s fault is
              not clear, and evidence of negligence may require significant
              investigation to uncover. For this reason, anyone who was hurt in
              a bicycle accident involving a motor vehicle should review the
              facts of the accident with an attorney.

            Bicycle Accident Statute Of Limitations

          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              A statute of limitations requires a person to bring a legal action
              within a certain period of time after an incident occurs. This law
              exists for many reasons—the reliability and quality of evidence
              can deteriorate during time, and potential defendants should have
              some degree of certainty whether they face a lawsuit for an act
              that occurred in the distant past.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Under Pennsylvania law, bicycle accident victims (and all other
              people injured in accidents) have two years from the date of the
              injury to bring claims. There are some limited exceptions to this
              rule, but typically, if you wait longer than two years to file a
              claim, you will lose your right to recover compensation for your
              accident-related losses.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              This is not to say that accident victims should wait one year and
              364 days to file their claims. As mentioned above, the
              availability and reliability of evidence tend to degrade over
              time—memories fade, witnesses move away, surveillance footage is
              erased—so it is best to retain a bicycle accident lawyer as soon
              as possible after an accident. A bicycle accident lawyer will
              begin any necessary investigation immediately, maximizing your
              chances of recovering compensation for your losses.

            <p className="TextPassage">
              As reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
              (NHTSA), almost 50,000 bicyclists suffered injuries in
              traffic-related accidents in 2012 alone.[1] Many of these injured
              bicyclists naturally wonder: how can I hold a driver responsible
              for my injuries? Your first step after a bicycle accident should
              always be to consult with an experienced personal injury attorney
              for free. A bike accident lawyer can advise you on whether or not
              you have the right to recover depending on the facts of your
              particular case.

          <h1 className="MainHeading">Determining Negligence</h1>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Often, drivers collide into bicyclists because they are not paying
              attention, not following traffic laws, or acting in an otherwise
              negligent manner. Not surprisingly, most drivers will not readily
              come forward and admit that they were distracted or failed to
              yield or made some other type of mistake. For this reason,
              identifying negligence in a bicycle accident often requires
              further investigation and analysis.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              One sign that often helps determine who was at fault in a bicycle
              accident is the type of collision that occurred. The four most
              common types of bicycle accidents are as follows:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>The Side Swipe </span>– this
                collision usually happens when a motorist fails to properly look
                for a bicyclist prior to changing lanes. Rear-end Collisions – a
                driver may hit a bicycle from behind if he or she is following
                the bicycle too closely, misjudges the bicycle’s speed, is
                speeding, or is driving in an otherwise aggressive manner.
                Conversely, the bicyclist may collide with the rear-end of a car
                if the driver stops suddenly and without warning.{" "}

              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>The “Left Cross” –</span>
                this occurs when a driver attempts to make a left turn at an
                intersection and runs into a bicyclist traveling in the opposite
                direction. It also may happen that a vehicle turns in front of a
                bicyclist, who then does not have time to stop and subsequently
                runs into the car.{" "}

              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>The “Right Hook”[2] </span>–
                the opposite of a Left Cross, this collision results from a
                driver trying to pass a bicyclist on the left side and then turn
                right in front of the bicyclist. This often happens when a
                driver is impatient with the relatively slow speed of a
                bicycle.The type of collision that occurred can speak volumes as
                to the potentially negligent acts of the driver involved, and a

            Do I Need A Lawyer If The Insurance Company Wants To Settle?
          </h1>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              A perhaps misunderstood reality of personal injury law is that the
              vast majority of cases settle out of court—sometimes without a
              lawsuit ever being filed. This is because in many cases, liability
              is not contested, which means that the at-fault party (or, more
              accurately, the insurance company) concedes liability. This leaves
              damages as the only issue that needs resolution.
            </p>
            <p className="TextPassage">
              In such cases, retaining an attorney may seem pointless, but this
              could not be further from the truth. Establishing damages in
              personal injury cases is complicated, and many, like pain and
              suffering and future medical expenses, are subjective and
              speculative. For this reason, settling a case with an insurance
              company runs the risk of accepting an offer that is far less than
              what your case is actually worth. An experienced attorney will
              determine how much your case is really worth and ensure that the
              insurance company treats you fairly. If the insurance company
              refuses to offer an acceptable settlement, your bicycle accident
              lawyer may file a lawsuit on your behalf to ensure that you get
              the compensation you deserve.
