      Negligence Leads to Preventable Philadelphia Bus Accident Injuries
     </h1>

     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) estimates that
       intercity buses account for about 13 percent of fatal bus crashes
       throughout the United States every year. Likewise, fatal school bus
       crashes account for approximately 40 percent, and transit buses total 35
       percent of all fatal bus crashes in the nation annually. Additionally,
       well over 20,000 people suffer injuries in bus crashes each year.
       Unfortunately, some of those fatal and injury-causing bus crashes occur
       in Pennsylvania, right here in the Greater Philadelphia area.
      </p>

      <p className="TextPassage">
       Negligent behavior by bus drivers, bus owners, and third-parties causes
       the majority of preventable bus accidents. Some scenarios that can lead
       to severe, sometimes fatal bus accidents and injuries include:

     <h1 className="MainHeading">Drunk/Drugged Driving Bus Accidents</h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       Drunk Driving impairs a bus driver’s ability to control the bus and to
       react to dangerous driving situations, especially when other drivers make
       quick stops or sudden turns. All bus drivers must hold a commercial
       drivers’ license (CDL), which means their legal blood alcohol is half of
       that for other drivers, and they must also submit to random drug and
       alcohol screenings. Bus drivers who make the tragic mistake of drinking
       and driving put others on the road and their own passengers at risk for
       injury and death.
      </p>
     </div>

     <h1 className="MainHeading">Distracted Driving Bus Accidents</h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       CDL holders must comply with federal laws regarding cell phone use while
       driving, so cell phone use is not as likely a distraction for bus drivers
       as you might think. Drivers cannot use a cell phone while operating a bus
       unless they use a hands-free device. Yet, bus drivers confront many other
       potential distractions that can lead to an accident, and of course other
       motorists may fall prey to distractions and cause an accident. Some
       examples of distractions that can affect bus drivers, besides
       smartphones, include misbehaving passengers, eating and drinking behind
       the wheel, concentrating on an event outside the bus, adjusting a seat or
       other vehicle features, and daydreaming.

     </div>
     <h1 className="MainHeading">Drowsy Driving Bus Accidents</h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       Bus drivers who work long shifts or have other jobs put passengers and
       other motorists at risk if they drive while drowsy or fatigued. The FMCSA
       has devoted extensive resources to study the relationship between sleep
       and driving. In their research, they found that drivers who go without
       sleep for 18 hours have the same level of impairment as those who have a
       blood alcohol level of 0.08, which is double the legal limit for bus
       drivers.

      Improper Passing/Failure to Yield Bus Accidents
     </h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       In some situations, bus passengers suffer injuries because another
       motorist causes an accident. Drivers in passenger vehicles often get
       impatient around slow-moving buses, so they pass them illegally or fail
       to yield when the bus has the right of way. This can lead to dangerous
       and deadly accidents and can also put passengers in danger as they exit
       and enter the bus, especially in situations where kids on a school bus
       must cross the road. Bus drivers can also pass improperly and fail to
       yield, but this type of accident happens more often as a result of
       third-party negligence.
      </p>
     </div>

     <h1 className="MainHeading">Disobeying Traffic Control Devices</h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       It’s not likely a bus driver will intentionally disobey a stop sign or
       traffic light. Yet, if a driver gets distracted and does not obey a
       traffic control device, a dangerous accident can occur. The size and
       weight of a bus contribute to a forceful impact in a collision with a
       smaller vehicle, making these kinds of accidents especially dangerous
       when a crash happens at high speeds. Drivers of passenger vehicles who
       fail to stop for a school bus can also cause accidents and injuries,
       including tragically hitting a child crossing the road.
      </p>
     </div>

     <h1 className="MainHeading">Poor Bus Maintenance</h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       Many entities own buses in our region, including the City of
       Philadelphia, school districts, and private charter bus companies. All
       bus owners have a responsibility to inspect their buses regularly, to
       perform regular maintenance on them, and to fix any known issues to
       ensure buses stay in roadworthy condition. Poorly maintained buses will
       eventually experience some type of mechanical or structural failure that
       can cause severe accidents. Preventable breakdowns like a tire blowout or
       brake failure can cause a bus driver to lose control and lead to a deadly
       collision.
      </p>
     </div>

     <h1 className="MainHeading">Overcrowding Buses</h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       Buses have weight limits above which a driver may struggle to maintain
       control, leading to an accident. Overcrowding typically does not present
       a problem on scheduled school bus or SEPTA routes. Yet, special events
       can sometimes lead to overcrowded SEPTA buses. Private charters, too, do
       not always comply with passenger and weight limit regulations.
       Overcrowded buses filled with unruly passengers are even more dangerous.
       If weight is not distributed evenly, the driver can also lose control of
       the bus.

      Poor Hiring and Training Practices of Bus Drivers
     </h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       The City of Philadelphia, school districts, and bus companies have an
       obligation to hire qualified bus drivers and adequately train them. Some
       drivers who have the required CDL do not necessarily have the experience
       to handle the responsibilities of a bus driver, a position that requires
       far more than just driving. Bus drivers are responsible for the safety of
       their passengers, and they must deal with continuous stopping and
       starting, often in busy traffic. Perfecting these tasks requires time,
       practice, and periodic retraining. Bus companies and other entities that
       hire unqualified drivers or do not take the time to train new drivers
       properly open themselves up to liability if one of their drivers causes
       an accident as a result of inexperience.

       Your own insurance coverage may help you to pay some of the expenses

       you need to regain your health and rebuild your life.

      <p className="TextPassage">
       Options for taking legal action against someone whose unreasonably
       dangerous decisions or actions led to a bus crash vary from
       victim-to-victim and crash-to-crash. However, as a general matter
       Pennsylvania law entitles injured individuals to seek compensation
       through a personal injury lawsuit against those at-fault parties. To
       exercise those rights, victims must act within two years of their injury
       in most cases. Rare exceptions exist, but for most people a court will
       probably not allow your bus accident claim to proceed if you do not file
       it before the two-year time limit expires.

       No one can guarantee that any claim will result in a favorable outcome,

     <h1 className="MainHeading">How dangerous are buses in an accident?</h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       Very. In a collision, a bus can cause extensive damage to a vehicle, and
       the force of the impact can result in devastating injuries to its own
       passengers, occupants of other vehicles and even pedestrians and
       bicyclists. As just one tragic example,several children still die each
       year in school bus accidents around the country.
      </p>
      <p className="TextPassage">
       The scary truth belies our preconceived notion that buses constitute a
       particularly safe mode of transportation because:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li className="TextPassage">
        They are large vehicles which absorb accident impact and force over a
        larger area
       </li>

       <li className="TextPassage">They generally travel at slower speeds</li>
       <li className="TextPassage">They have professional drivers</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="TextPassage">
       However, each of those facts has an important counterpoint. Yes, buses
       are large, but that means they inflict massive damage in an impact. Some
       buses travel at slower than average speeds (such as SEPTA buses on a
       crowded Philly street), but not all of them, as anyone who has shared a
       highway with a long-distance coach bus knows. Although true that buses
       have professional drivers, that does not always make them safer.
      </p>

      <p className="TextPassage">
       The reality is that buses in and around Philadelphia get into accidents
       pretty regularly, and those crashes cause significant harm.

      Who owes me money for my Philadelphia bus accident injuries?

      <p className="TextPassage">
       That all depends on the facts and circumstances of the crash that injured
       you. As a general matter, in Pennsylvania, anyone whose unreasonably
       dangerous decisions or actions lead to an accident or incident that harms
       someone else will bear legal liability to that injured victim for
       monetary damages.
      </p>

      <p className="TextPassage">
       All sorts of individuals and entities might meet those criteria when it
       comes to a Philadelphia bus accident. As lawyers for Philly bus crash
       victims, we will often investigate:
      </p>

      <ul>
       <li className="TextPassage">
        Bus drivers, whose actions behind the wheel could lead to a crash;
       </li>

       <li className="TextPassage">
        Bus owners/operators (including City agencies like SEPTA), both because
        they may have a legal obligation to answer for the actions of any driver
        they employ, or because their own decisions made a bus less safe for
        travel;
       </li>
       <li className="TextPassage">
        Bus manufacturers, if they produced a bus part that failed under normal
        operating conditions and led to a crash (such as a faulty braking
        system); and
       </li>
       <li className="TextPassage">
        Bus maintenance contractors whose work should keep buses in safe
        operating condition, and could lead to a crash if it does not.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="TextPassage">
       These are just a few examples of who may have legal liability for damages
       to victims of a Philadelphia bus crash. Every accident has its own facts
       that determine who bears the blame. Sometimes, more than one individual
       or entity can share fault for a crash, in fact.

      <p className="TextPassage">
       Identifying the parties with legal liability for a Philly bus crash can

        may need urgent medical care and you have no time to lose in calling it.
        Police who respond to the scene will prepare an accident report. If they
        want to speak with you, answer their questions plainly and simply. Say
        nothing that they could mistake as an admission that you bear some of
        the blame for the crash. Just stick to the facts.

        Always let an EMT check you over at the scene of a Philadelphia bus
        accident. If the EMT recommends you take an ambulance ride to the
        hospital, then do it. If the EMT gives you the all-clear, then still
        follow up with your regular doctor or an urgent care clinic within 24
        hours of the accident. You always need a full examination after any
        Philadelphia bus crash to make sure you have not suffered hidden
        injuries that do not show immediate symptoms but could still threaten
        your health (or even your life). Not only does going to the doctor
        protect your wellbeing, it also generates important medical records that
        could help prove the connection between the crash and your injuries in a
        legal action.

         Take pictures or video, if you can.{' '}
        </span>
        It is not always possible to do so safely, but if you can, take pictures
        or video of the accident scene with your smartphone, ideally before the
        first responders and clean-up crews show up. Take as many pictures or as
        much video as you possibly can, documenting every aspect of an accident
        scene that you can see. There is no such thing as too much photographic
        or video evidence of a Philadelphia bus crash scene.

         Get people’s contact info, if you can.{' '}
        </span>
        In the same vein, ask people for their names and contact information, if
        you can do so safely and without getting in first responders’ way. The
        easiest way to do this might be to video them telling it to you, but any
        method will do. The police will probably also gather this information,
        but it never hurts to back up their efforts, particularly on a crowded,
        chaotic accident scene. The information you gather could help your
        lawyers identify and track down people who have important information
        about the crash.

      What type of compensation can I get for my injuries?
     </h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       It depends upon the fact and circumstances of your Philadelphia bus
       accident. Keep in mind that no lawyer can promise you will receive any
       compensation for your injuries. To receive money damages, your lawyer
       must first have the ability to prove that someone has legal liability to
       you as we described above, and of course, the person or entity with
       liability actually must also have the ability to pay you.
      </p>
      <p className="TextPassage">
       As a general matter, however, victims of Philadelphia bus crashes may
       have rights to receive compensation for:
      </p>

      <ul>
       <li className="TextPassage">
        Medical and other expenses caused by the accident and the injuries you
        suffered;
       </li>

       <li className="TextPassage">
        Wages you missed out on earning while recuperating, or that you may not
        earn in the future because of injury-related disabilities;
       </li>
       <li className="TextPassage">
        Your physical pain, emotional suffering, and any decline in your quality
        of life resulting from your bus accident injuries.
       </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="TextPassage">
       Working with an experienced Philadelphia bus accident injury attorney is
       the most reliable way to calculate the damages you should receive, to
       identify the parties who owe those damages to you, and to build a case to
       prove that liability and get you paid.
      </p>
     </div>

     <h1 className="MainHeading">
      Someone offered me a settlement for my bus accident injuries. Should I
      take it?
     </h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       No, at least not without first speaking with an experienced Philadelphia
       bus accident attorney about your rights.
      </p>
      <p className="TextPassage">
       Anyone other than your own insurance company who offers you money or some
       other form of compensation to pay for your bus accident injuries does so
       for only one reason: because they think they have legal liability to you
       for damages. An unsolicited settlement offer means they really think they
       owe you damages, and most likely that they hope you will take less money
       than you deserve if they offer it quickly.
      </p>

      <p className="TextPassage">
       Settling a case, however, means giving up your valuable legal rights to
       sue someone for damages. If you take a settlement for too-little money,
       you cannot later go back to the person who paid you and ask for more.
       It’s a one-and-done deal, so you had better make sure you get the most
       money possible.
      </p>

      <p className="TextPassage">
       That is where an experienced Philadelphia bus accident injury lawyer
       comes in handy. Lawyers who represent injured accident victims have years
       of experience negotiating hard with insurance companies, defense lawyers,
       and others to get their clients maximum compensation for injuries and
       losses. Always hire a bus accident attorney to do that work for you, too.

     <h1 className="MainHeading">
      How long do I have to take legal action for damages?
     </h1>
     <div className="ImageTextHolder">
      <p className="TextPassage">
       In Pennsylvania,you only have two years after the date of your accident
       to file a personal injury claim. Two years might seem like a long time,
       but for bus accident lawyers, it is barely a blink-of-the-eye. Even so,
       even waiting just two years to take legal action to enforce your rights
       to compensation could cost you thousands of dollars or more.
      </p>
      <p className="TextPassage">
       The best time to seek help from an experienced Philadelphia bus accident
       injury lawyer is as soon as possible after the crash that injures you.
       That is when evidence is easiest to collect, witness memories are at
       their freshest, and parties with legal liability feel the most pressure
       to answer for their wrongful actions. As time passes, evidence
       disappears, memories fade, and people who should pay you money start to
       find excuses for why not to.
      </p>

      <p className="TextPassage">
       So, do not wait. Contact a bus accident lawyer immediately to preserve
       your valuable legal rights.

     <h1 className="MainHeading">Why do I need a bus accident lawyer?</h1>
