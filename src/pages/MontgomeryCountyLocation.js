            It can be nearly impossible to predict if and when a person will be involved in a life changing accident. This is in large part due to the fact that while we can control our own behavior and actions, we cannot control the actions of those around us. Unfortunately, the negligent or reckless decisions of a few can have devastating consequences for others. For instance, one driver’s decision to speed or otherwise drive recklessly can endanger the safety of anyone else on the road. While negligent parties can cause innocent individuals to suffer serious and painful injuries, victims are not without recourse and may be eligible to receive compensation for their losses, which will allow them to begin the long road to recovery. At The Lawyer Connection, we are dedicated to representing the interests of those who have been injured as a result of the negligent or reckless decisions of others, so if you were recently involved in an accident,

            Nobody knows how they will respond to an injury until it actually happens. You can plan all day long to how you will react, what you will do, and the steps you need to take, but when the time comes, you may react completely differently than you expected. We don’t plan for injuries. They take us off guard and can leave us at a loss.

 In the ideal world, we’d all have emergency reserves set aside and a backup daycare provider to watch the kids so we can focus on our recovery. We’d adapt and push right through. But that’s not how things happen. Because these injuries are so unpredictable, they often leave us with questions. “What do I do?” “Who do I call?” and “How on earth am I going to pay these bills?” While we don’t have all the answers regarding how you will respond to an accident, we can answer some of the most common questions that might arise.

            To understand whether you have a personal injury case, it’s important to understand what personal injury actually is. In the legal context, a personal injury is harm caused by someone else’s careless, reckless, or intentionally harmful actions, for which the law entitles you to recover compensation from the wrongdoer. Personal injuries arise frequently in the context of:

                Motor vehicle accidents happen every day. In recent years, Pennsylvania has seen an increase in the number of reported crashes and motor vehicle fatalities. Motor vehicle accident attorneys may frequently represent clients injured in collisions involving cars, trucks, semi-trucks, commercial vehicles, motorcycles, and pedestrians.

                Slip and fall accidents can happen at a place of business or a personal residence. Though they are referred to as slip and fall, the term generally covers any circumstance in which a person gets injured in a preventable fall. These accidents often happen because of slippery surfaces, loose items, uneven flooring or sidewalk, or other icy or wet conditions.

                Medical malpractice happens when a doctor or other healthcare professional makes a mistake that leads to the injury of a patient. Medical malpractice does not include undesirable outcomes or a shorter life expectancy than expected. Examples of medical malpractice include dosage errors, missed or delayed diagnosis, surgical mistakes, and failure to read the patient’s medical history.

            Here are a few common words and phrases that you might hear while working with a Montgomery County personal injury attorney:

            <ul>
              <li className="TextPassage">
              Negligence is a legal concept that refers to a wrongful, but not intentional, action or omission that causes harm to someone else.

              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
              Damages are the sum-total of the harm that someone’s wrongful actions caused. Damages come in two general types: economic and non-economic. Economic damages consist of harms that have a direct, out-of-pocket, financial cost associated with them, such as medical bills or lost wages. Non-economic damages refer to harms that do not have a price tag associated with them, but are no less real and significant as those that do, such as pain, emotional distress, and loss of companionship.
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
              Liability is the word lawyers use to refer to someone having a legal obligation to pay damages for an injury.
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
              Comparative negligence stands for the idea that sometimes more than one person or entity takes wrongful action that causes damages, making it necessary to compare the degrees of negligence to figure out how much liability they each have.
              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
              Statute of limitations is the time limit set by law for taking legal action for damages in a particular circumstance.
              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
              Contingency or contingent fee is how personal injury lawyers get paid. Instead of billing their clients by the hour or by the legal service performed, personal injury lawyers and their clients agree on a percentage the lawyer will receive of any financial settlement or jury award. This arrangement helps to put lawyers and their clients on the same wavelength; the more money the lawyer gets for the client, the more money the lawyer earns.

              </li>
              <li className="TextPassage">
              Letter of protection is a document a lawyer may send to a medical provider promising to pay medical services out of any personal injury settlement or award the lawyer’s client receives, in exchange for the medical professional deferring any action to collect a medical debt.

            <p className="TextPassage">
            It is virtually impossible to determine the value of a case right after an injury. The amount of money you should receive as compensation for a personal injury claim depends upon a variety of factors, some of which may take time and investigation to pinpoint, including:

                People respond differently to injuries. It is difficult to self-diagnose and determine the degree of your injuries without seeking medical care. Prompt medical attention can prevent further injury and may even save your life. It will also generate important medical records that your attorney may need to prove your case.              </li>

              <li className="TextPassage">
                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Do not throw anything away.</span>
                Keep any records or documents you receive from your doctor or from any insurance company. Do not throw away anything that might help someone understand how your injury happened or the harm it has caused.              </li>

                <span style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}>Seek legal help.</span>
                After an injury, you deserve fair and just compensation. You shouldn’t have to cover the costs of your injuries on your own. A Montgomery County personal injury attorney helps you protect your rights and recover the compensation you deserve.              </li>

          <h2 className="MainHeading">Request a Recorded Statement</h2>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Insurance adjusters typically request recorded statements from
              claimants. Sometimes they convey that giving a recorded statement
              will help your claim. You have no legal obligation to let them
              record you, and doing so can help the adjuster limit any
              settlement offer. Insurance representatives comb over recorded
              statements for justification to challenge your claim for damages,
              dispute liability, shift blame, or for anything that will help
              them reduce the value of your claim. Letting your attorney handle
              communication with the insurance company can protect you from
              these tactics and prevent the adjuster from using your statements
              against you.

            Talk You Out of Consulting with a Lawyer
          </h2>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Insurance companies prefer claimants who do not have legal
              representation. They know that lawyers understand the claims
              process, understand how to apply the law, and make it difficult
              for them to prey on slip and fall accident victims and other
              victims of negligence. Additionally, lawyers are all too familiar
              with the questionable tactics insurance companies use to avoid
              financial liability for their policyholders.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              You can expect an adjuster to tell you your claim is
              straightforward and you do not need to talk with a lawyer. This
              claim may or may not be true. It’s always best to consult with an
              experienced slip and fall accident attorney to let them review
              your case. Even in straightforward cases, a lawyer can often help
              clients obtain more compensation for their injuries.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h2 className="MainHeading">Make a Settlement Offer</h2>
          <div className="ImageTextHolder">
            <p className="TextPassage">
              Insurance adjusters who know their policyholder is at fault for a
              slip and fall accident sometimes make early settlement offers. If
              you accept a settlement offer, you must also sign an agreement
              that prevents you from seeking more compensation for the same slip
              and fall accident and injuries. Often, people believe the
              insurance adjuster made them a reasonable offer. They discover
              later that the amount was much lower than they deserved for their
              injuries. An attorney can evaluate the offer and use it as a
              starting point for negotiations.
            </p>

            <p className="TextPassage">
              Slip and fall accident lawyers also recognize when settlement is
              not an option, and they need to file a lawsuit on behalf of their
              client. Filing a lawsuit can motivate the insurance company to
              make a better offer to avoid an expensive trial and a larger
              potential payout if a jury rules in your favor.
