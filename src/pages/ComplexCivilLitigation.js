                    <div className='Data-SubText'>How can I determine whether I have a valid civil rights or discrimination claim?</div>
                    <div className='Data-Paragraph'>Civil rights are personal rights guaranteed and protected by the U.S. Constitution and federal laws enacted by Congress, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. Many states have also enacted their own civil rights and anti-discrimination laws. Civil rights include protection from unlawful discrimination, equal protection under the law, and rights to due process. Civil rights laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of protected classes, determined on the basis of race, color, national origin, disability, age, sex, and religion. If you believe that you have been discriminated against on the basis of a protected class, you may have a valid civil rights or discrimination claim. Many civil rights claims may first be brought before neutral fact-finding agencies or commissions that investigate allegations of discrimination. Our firm would assist you in your interactions with such neutral fact-finding agencies and work with you to make determinations regarding a filing of corresponding or subsequent court claims.</div>
